# Practical_2: RESTful API Weather Application

## Overview:

This is a simple web application that demonstrates the use of RESTful API methods — **GET**, **POST**, **PUT**, and **DELETE** — using public APIs. The project features a tabbed interface to interact with weather data and manage saved locations.

## Installation:

1. **Clone or Download the Repository**
   git clone <https://github.com/Yesheylhaden/WEB101_Practicals_02240371.git>
   cd your-project-folder
2. Run the Application
- Open index.html in any modern web browser.
- No server setup required.

## Usages:

- **GET** – Retrieve current weather details for any city using OpenWeatherMap API.
- **POST** – Add new favorite locations via the JSONPlaceholder mock API.
- **PUT** – Modify information of an existing saved location.
- **DELETE** – Remove unwanted saved locations from the list.
- **UI-Based Testing** – Easily perform and test all RESTful operations through a user-friendly web interface.

## Features:

- **Tabbed Interface:** Easily switch between different API operations (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
- **Live Weather Lookup:** Fetch and display real-time weather information for any city using the OpenWeatherMap API.
- **Save Locations:** Add new favorite locations with a simple form using the JSONPlaceholder API.
- **Edit Locations:** Update saved location details seamlessly with an edit modal.
- **Delete Locations:** Remove saved locations quickly with a delete button.
- **Responsive UI:** Clean and user-friendly design for easy navigation and interaction.
- **API Integration:** Demonstrates interaction with two public APIs to handle multiple REST methods.
- **Client-Side Validation:** Basic form validations for input correctness before API calls.
- **No Server Setup Required:** Runs directly in the browser by opening index.html.

## Technologies:

- **HTML5:** for structuring the user interface and forms
- **CSS3:** for styling the application and creating a clean layout
- **JavaScript (ES6+):** for handling UI interactions and making API calls
- **Fetch API:** to perform asynchronous HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- **OpenWeatherMap API:** to retrieve live weather data
- **JSONPlaceholder API:** a fake online REST API used for simulating saving, updating, and deleting data
- **Browser:** the application runs directly in modern web browsers without server setup

## Conclusion:

- This project successfully demonstrates how to build a simple yet functional RESTful API application by integrating multiple HTTP methods — GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE — with public APIs. It highlights the practical use of fetching live data, creating, updating, and deleting resources, all within a clean and interactive browser-based UI. Through this exercise, I gained valuable experience working with asynchronous JavaScript, API communication, and user interface design, which are essential skills for modern web development.

## Acknowledgments:

- I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my instructor and peers for their continuous support and guidance throughout this practical project. Special thanks to the developers and communities behind the OpenWeatherMap and JSONPlaceholder APIs for providing excellent resources to learn and experiment with RESTful API operations. This project would not have been possible without their valuable tools and documentation.

## Practical 4: Connecting TikTok Frontend to Backend

### a) Documentation
- Used Axios to connect to a custom Express API.
- Managed authentication using JWT and context.
- Built modals and services for real-time data (likes, comments).
- Used `.env` to manage base API URLs.

### b) Reflection
This practical was one of the most complex. I struggled with setting up the auth context and integrating JWT tokens correctly. Debugging login/logout behavior and ensuring tokens were sent properly took time. Eventually, I understood how context and protected routes work in full-stack apps.

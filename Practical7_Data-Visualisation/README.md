## Installation:

1. **Clone the Repository**
git clone <https://github.com/Yesheylhaden/WEB101_Practicals_02240371.git>
cd Data-Visualisation

2. **Install Dependencies**
npm install

## Usages:

- View multiple charts in one dashboard.
- Hover on chart points to get tooltips and insights.
- Resize the window to test responsive behavior.
- Monitor customer acquisition growth with a Bar Chart.
- Gain insights through responsive, real-time visualizations.

## Features:

- Interactive and responsive charts
- Multiple chart types: Line, Pie, Bar, Area
- Modular and reusable React components
- Clean and simple dashboard layout
- Real-time data transformation and display
- Lightweight and optimized performance

## Technologies:

- **React:** JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Recharts:** Charting library for Line and Pie charts.
- **react-chartjs-2:** Wrapper for Chart.js used for Bar and Area charts.
- **Chart.js:** Base charting engine used by react-chartjs-2.
- **Vite:** Development server and build tool.

## Conclusion:

- This practical helped reinforce key concepts in data visualization using React. By integrating Recharts and Chart.js, I learned how to build an interactive and responsive dashboard with multiple chart types. It was a valuable hands-on experience in transforming raw data into meaningful visual insights and optimizing chart components for performance and usability.

## Acknowledgments:

- I would like to thank my instructor for the guidance and support throughout this practical. Special thanks to the developers of Recharts and Chart.js for their powerful libraries and documentation, which made implementing data visualizations seamless and educational.

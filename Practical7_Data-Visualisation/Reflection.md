# Reflection on Data Visualization Dashboard.

## Main Concepts Applied:

- **Chart Integration in React:** Used Recharts and react-chartjs-2 to render different types of charts within a React app.
- **Data-Driven UI Components:** Built reusable components that visualize different sets of data.
- **Responsive Design:** Ensured charts adapt to screen size changes using built-in responsiveness features.
- **Data Formatting & Transformation:** Manipulated raw datasets to fit the requirements of various chart types.

## Things I Learned:

- How to implement and customize Line, Pie, Bar, and Area charts in React.
- The difference between Recharts and react-chartjs-2 in terms of usage and flexibility.
- The importance of structuring data properly for accurate and clean visual representation.
- How interactivity and responsiveness enhance the usability of analytics dashboards.

## Challenges and Solutions:

- **Challenge:** Struggled with different data formats required by Recharts and Chart.js.  
  **Solution:** Carefully reviewed the documentation and transformed data arrays into the expected structures.

- **Challenge:** Ensuring consistent layout and responsiveness across all charts.  
  **Solution:** Used container wrappers and responsive props provided by the chart libraries.

- **Challenge:** Managing chart imports and preventing errors related to version conflicts.  
  **Solution:** Checked compatibility in `package.json` and installed the latest stable versions of the charting libraries.

##  Conclusion:

This practical gave me a solid understanding of data visualization in web development using React. I learned how to build a clean dashboard interface that presents data effectively through charts. The hands-on experience boosted my skills in integrating third-party libraries, managing state-driven data visualization, and creating modular, user-friendly components.
